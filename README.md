<h1 align = "center"> Air Quality Index in India</h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

This project analyzes air quality data across India, focusing on key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) over the years. The analysis aims to identify pollution trends, state-wise pollution levels, and types of particulate matter to provide insights into air quality issues.

<h2>Data Analysis: </h2>

- __Average NO₂, SO₂, and RSPM Throughout the Years:__
    - This analysis tracks the average levels of NO₂, SO₂, and RSPM across multiple years, allowing for an assessment of long-term air quality trends in India.
- __States Having Highest Pollution:__
    - A comprehensive examination of states with the highest pollution levels, providing insights into geographic disparities in air quality across the country.
- __Most Number of Observations:__
    - This section highlights the states or regions with the most air quality observations, reflecting data collection efforts and monitoring intensity.
- __NO₂ vs. RSPM:__
    - A comparative analysis of NO₂ and RSPM levels, illustrating the relationship between these two pollutants and their potential impact on health and the environment.
- __Type and Count of SPM:__
    - This analysis categorizes the various types of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and their respective counts, shedding light on the sources and types of particulate pollution.
- __Map of India:__
    - A geographical representation of air quality data across India, visually showcasing pollution levels by state and enhancing spatial understanding of air quality issues.

<h2>Dashboard Integration</h2>

The project culminates in a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that synthesizes insights from all the analyses. The dashboard features interactive visualizations that allow users to explore air quality data dynamically, facilitating a better understanding of pollution trends and impacts across India.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This project serves as an important resource for policymakers, researchers, and the public, highlighting critical air quality issues and encouraging informed decision-making to address pollution challenges in India.
